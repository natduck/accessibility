We used several machine learning models in Python to predict the strength and correlation of transport ratings, bikeability, walkability, and real estate values as well as the magnitude of their effects. Our goal in predicting relationships between these variables is to show the pitfalls of certain cities when it comes to accessibility to resources and to contribute to the discovery of methods that can mitigate these difficulties.
